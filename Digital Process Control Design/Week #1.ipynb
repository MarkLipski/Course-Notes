    "### Root Locus Drawing\n",
    "Know how to draw the root locus approximately, don't need to know how to calculate breakaway points, angles of deperture, little details, just need back of the envelope approximations.\n",
    "Things to know\n",
    "- Centroid calculation: $\\sigma = \\frac{\\sum P - \\sum Z}{P - Z}$, where $Z =$ zeroes and $P =$ poles\n",
    "- Angle of asymptotes, passing through centroid $\\theta_a = \\left(\\frac{2a + 1}{P - Z}\\right)180^{\\circ}$, where a denotes the number of the respective asymptote.\n",
    "- Root locus starts at poles, moves to zeros. Unpaired poles move to infinity, unpaired zeros come from infinity.\n",
    "- (No, yes, No): Segments of the root locus on the real axis follow this pattern from right to left.\n",

    "### Bode Plots\n",
    "#### Magnitude Plot\n",
    "- Left of a zero, increase by 10dB per decade\n",
    "- Right of a pole, decrease by 10db per decade\n",
    "- Label midband with the gain of the system\n",
    "- Label both axis\n",

    "#### Phase Plot\n",
    "- If the sign of the transfer function is negative, the phase plot starts at -180$^{\\circ}$\n",
    "- Poles and zeros at 0, subtract an additional 90$^{\\circ}$ or add an additional 90$^{\\circ}$\n",
    "- Around negative poles and zeros\n",
