<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >It&#8217;s rather difficult to explain the motivations behind microcomputer interfacing
without first understanding what a micro controller is. Most people are relatively well
acquainted with microprocessors, they&#8217;re what power phones, or any personal
computer. Micro-controllers on the other hand function as low power digital
control systems and are found in a significant portion of your household
electronics.
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >   There are a number of differences between micro-controllers and microprocessors.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1   </span> <a

<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >Pros
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Substantial number of different micro-controllers available, can usually
     find a micro that meets your system requirements
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Can be extremely low power
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Can interface a substantial number of peripherals</li></ul>

     <li class="itemize">Low data processing capacity</li></ul>
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-40001.3"></a>Hardware Differences</h4>
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >A microprocessor almost always has RAM, as well as a relatively long pipeline.
Micro-controllers(MCUs) are typically single core processors with a relatively short
pipeline between 1-7 stages, micro-controllers don&#8217;t usually have RAM, and instead
rely upon flash memory to store both data and program code. Most MCUs also have
a substantially lower clock rate of between (10-500)MHz.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   It should be noted that the classification of a processor isn&#8217;t black and white,
many of the characteristics of MCUs and microprocessors can be interchanged, for
instance, there can be an MCU with a substantially higher clock rate of around
300MHz which is substantially better at processing data, however it still may not
have RAM or an operating system, and would likely still be classified as an
MCU.
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   These are all the superficial differences between MCUs and microprocessors, and
essentially all you need to understand for micro computer interface.
                                                                  <img 
src="chapter17x.png" alt="PICT" >

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-50002"></a>Course Motivations</h3>
<!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" >Now that you have an idea of what an MCU is, hopefully you can now derive some
reasons for learning the information in this course.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >   MCUs are often used in control systems. They can be very digital in
nature, or even replace analog control systems due to their diversity and how
inexpensive they are. They can be used in DSP(Digital Signal Processing)
applications, control a car, run your microwave, or any given number of
applications.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >   Some more interesting examples of MCU use would be something like a fitbit. A
fitbit is essentially an accelerometer hooked up to an MCU which then transmits the
accelerometer data via bluetooth to your phone.//
<!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >   Important topics in Microcomputer interfacing are:

there is are a substantial number of peripherals for MCUs.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >   Unfortunately point number 4) isn&#8217;t something that can be taught and
must be learned over time spent working with technical documentation.
