Introduction
============

It’s rather difficult to explain the motivations behind microcomputer
interfacing without first understanding what a micro controller is. Most
people are relatively well acquainted with microprocessors, they’re what
power phones, or any personal computer. Micro-controllers on the other
hand function as low power digital control systems and are found in a
significant portion of your household electronics.

There are a number of differences between micro-controllers and
microprocessors.

Microprocessors
---------------

Pros

-   High Data Throughput

-   Large quantities of memory

-   Operating system

Cons

-   High power usage

-   High latency

-   Restricted to whatever peripherals can be interfaced via usb through
    the motherboard

-   Expensive

Micro-controllers
-----------------

Pros

-   Substantial number of different micro-controllers available, can
    usually find a micro that meets your system requirements

-   Can be extremely low power

-   Can interface a substantial number of peripherals

Cons

-   Low data processing capacity

Hardware Differences
--------------------

A microprocessor almost always has RAM, as well as a relatively long
pipeline. Micro-controllers(MCUs) are typically single core processors
with a relatively short pipeline between 1-7 stages, micro-controllers
don’t usually have RAM, and instead rely upon flash memory to store both
data and program code. Most MCUs also have a substantially lower clock
rate of between (10-500)MHz.\
It should be noted that the classification of a processor isn’t black
and white, many of the characteristics of MCUs and microprocessors can
be interchanged, for instance, there can be an MCU with a substantially
higher clock rate of around 300MHz which is substantially better at
processing data, however it still may not have RAM or an operating
system, and would likely still be classified as an MCU.

These are all the superficial differences between MCUs and
microprocessors, and essentially all you need to understand for micro
computer interface.

Course Motivations
==================

Now that you have an idea of what an MCU is, hopefully you can now
derive some reasons for learning the information in this course.\
MCUs are often used in control systems. They can be very digital in
nature, or even replace analog control systems due to their diversity
and how inexpensive they are. They can be used in DSP(Digital Signal
Processing) applications, control a car, run your microwave, or any
given number of applications.\
Some more interesting examples of MCU use would be something like a
fitbit. A fitbit is essentially an accelerometer hooked up to an MCU
which then transmits the accelerometer data via bluetooth to your
phone.//

Important topics in Microcomputer interfacing are:

1.  How to write low level C code and assembly to code on an MCU

2.  How to choose an appropriate micro for a given application

3.  Understand and be able to utilize the standard peripherals on most
    MCUs

4.  Get some practice reading technical documentation

5.  How to physically wire and interface an MCU

6.  How to properly debug an MCU using both software and
    hardware approaches.

Point number 3) is what will take up the bulk mass of the material in
these notes, as there is are a substantial number of peripherals for
MCUs.\
Unfortunately point number 4) isn’t something that can be taught and
must be learned over time spent working with technical documentation.
