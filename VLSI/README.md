# VLSI Notes
The purpose of these notes is to create a relatively comprehensive set of notes explaining the different core concepts of VLSI.

I'm going to attempt to upload 3 chapters a week, the completed notes will be uploaded as PDF's. All content is based on **CMOS Circuit Design, Layout, and Simulation, Third Edition** textbook, as are the textbook chapters, though I may revise and edit the chapters as time goes on.
